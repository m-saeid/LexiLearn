## **Python Project: Vocabulary Review App**  

### **Project Overview**  
In this project, you will develop a Python application that helps English learners review vocabulary using an interactive flashcard system, similar to Anki. The app will read vocabulary data from an **Excel file (Vocab.xlsx)** and allow users to review words and test their knowledge.  

### **Project Requirements**  

1. **Data Handling:**  
   - The vocabulary data will be stored in an Excel file (`Vocab.xlsx`).  
   - The file contains multiple **sheets**, each representing a different **unit** (e.g., Unit1, Unit2, etc.).  
   - Each sheet includes the following columns:  
     - **Word** (English word)  
     - **Persian Meaning** (Translation)  
     - **Part of Speech** (Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.)  
     - **Definition** (English explanation)  
     - **Pronunciation** (Phonetic representation)  
     - **Examples** (Example sentences in English)  

2. **Features to Implement:**  
   - A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using **Tkinter**.  
   - A **Main Menu** where users can select a unit and choose between:  
     - **Review Mode**: Displays flashcards with the word first, then reveals its meaning, definition, and example sentences.  
     - **Test Mode**: Provides multiple-choice questions where users select the correct Persian meaning of a word.  
   - **Randomization** of flashcards and test questions.  
   - **Navigation** buttons to move between words/questions.  
   - A **score tracking** system in Test Mode.  
   - A **back-to-menu option** to allow users to return and select a different unit.  

3. **Additional Features (Optional, for Extra Credit):**  
   - Implement **progress tracking** (saving scores for each unit).  
   - Add **audio pronunciation** support.  
   - Implement different test types (e.g., matching words with definitions).  
   - Improve the UI/UX with better design and animations.  

### **Technology & Libraries**  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)  
- **Pandas** (for reading Excel files)  
- **Random** (for shuffling words and options)  

### **Deliverables**  
- A fully functional Python script with a Tkinter GUI.  
- The `Vocab.xlsx` file (sample data).  
- A short report (or README file) explaining how to run the application.  

### **Grading Criteria**  
- **Functionality (40%)**: Does the app work as expected?  
- **User Interface (20%)**: Is the GUI intuitive and easy to navigate?  
- **Code Quality (20%)**: Is the code well-structured, documented, and efficient?  
- **Creativity & Additional Features (20%)**: Have you added any extra features or improved the UX?
